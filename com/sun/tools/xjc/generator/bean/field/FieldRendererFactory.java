/**
 * Factory for {@link FieldRenderer}.
 *
 * <p>
 * This class can be overridden by a plugin to change the code generation
 * behavior of XJC. Note that such changes aren't composable; for a given
 * schema compilation, only one instance of {@link FieldRendererFactory} is
 * used.
 *
 * <p>
 * See {@link Options#fieldRendererFactory}
 *
 * <p>
 * To be more precise, since {@link FieldRenderer} is just a strategy pattern
 * and by itself is stateless, the "factory methods" don't necessarily need
 * to create new instances of {@link FieldRenderer} --- it can just return
 * a set of pre-created instances.
